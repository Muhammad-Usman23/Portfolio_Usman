Portfolio — Usman

This is a static, responsive personal portfolio landing page built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

How to use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally.
2. To enable the contact form, create a Formspree form and set the `FORM_ENDPOINT` constant in `js/script.js` to your Formspree URL (e.g. https://formspree.io/f/yourid). If not set, the form will open the user's email client as a fallback.
3. Replace placeholder project images and links in `index.html` with your real projects.
4. Replace contact email and social links with your own.

Files added
- `index.html` — main site
- `css/styles.css` — styles and responsive layout
- `js/script.js` — interactivity (carousel, scroll reveals, form handler)
- `assets/resume.pdf` — minimal placeholder resume PDF

Notes
- The site uses Google Fonts; internet connection required for fonts. The page is otherwise static and runnable locally.
- Swap the placeholder resume at `assets/resume.pdf` with your actual CV. The resume link uses the `download` attribute for direct download.
